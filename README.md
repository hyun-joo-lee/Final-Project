# Scientific Question
The volcanoes around the world are emitting CO2 and the mantle is considered as massive carbon reservoir of the Earth. The carbon content from the volcanoes varies with the region (i.e. mid-ocean ridge, arc, and hotspot), however, the source below them, which is mainly upper mantle, do not varies with the region. The variation would be contributed by the processes between generation of magma and eruption. Thus, the mantle sourced carbon content and isotope values will be assessed in the case of South West Indian Ridge.

- **Question to professor:**
Can I use this table exporting by manually (e.g. using excel and reuploading to github...) or should I use python tool to export it?

# Summary of the analysis
- The carbon concentration and isotope values will be plotted on the map along the ridge to see the variaiton in the ridge scale.
- The depth versus and carbon concentration will be plotted to see degassing has occurred at the eruption level.
(Carbon concentration in the basaltic glass highly depends on the pressure.)
- The carbon content versus isotope will be plotted to see the carbon isotope varies with the degassing level.
